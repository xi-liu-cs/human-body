# human body with triangle meshes
Xi Liu</br>
This project is done for computer graphics course at New York University, fall 2022.</br>
The skeleton of the human body is constructed using a stack of matrices, a stack is used to model the tree structure transformations of each component of the human body with respect to its other components.</br>
You can interact with the simulation by changing the number of fingers, toes, and length of limbs, etc.</br>
